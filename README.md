# NorthwindOrderListProject
An ASP.NET Core MVC application was developed using the Northwind database. The screens in the application are as follows:
When the application is opened, the page listing the orders opens.
The order number, the date of the order, the name of the customer who placed the order, the first and last name of the employee who handled the order.
When the order number is clicked, the order detail page opens.
Here the current products are listed. The name of the product, its quantity in the order, and its price. If there is a discount, the price will appear discounted.
There is a shipper add page. After entering the required information, a new record is added.
